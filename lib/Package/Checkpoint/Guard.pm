# ABSTRACT: Checkpoint the scalar, array and hash values in a package for automatic restoration
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package Foo::Bar {
   our $foo = 1;
   our @bar = (1,2,3);
   our %baz = ( a => 1 );
 }

 {
   my $guard = Package::Checkpoint::Guard->new('Foo::Bar');

   # modify Foo::Bar
   $Foo::Bar::foo++;
   push @Foo::Bar::bar, 4;
   $Foo::Bar::baz{b} = 2;
 }
 # $guard falls out of scope...
 # [$@%]Foo::Bar::{foo,bar,baz} are now back to their original values
